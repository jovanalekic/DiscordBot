hi! here are my commands!

$category 
  -randomly chooses "kandi" or "perler" for you (50% chance to get either)

$kandi [options]
$perler [options]
  -the command tells me if you want ideas for kandi or perlers 
  -you can add options after the command to tell me what types of ideas you'd like me to suggest
    -the options are "theme", "color", and "type" 
    -you can write these 3 categories in any order or format (capital or lowercase does not matter)
    -write "all" as the option if you want me to just give you all 3 of them
For ex:
$kandi color theme
$perler type
$perler type color theme
$kandi all
